Using a javascript prototype allows the coder to add new functions and data to already existing javascript objects.
Objects are linked together by prototypes. Every object with the exception of the Object object are derived from a prototype.
When an object a's _proto_ property is assigned to another object, b. a inhertis all of b's properties and functions.
